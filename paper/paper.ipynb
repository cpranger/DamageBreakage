    "We present a numerical scheme for efficiently modeling the rheological evolution of rocks in response to changes in temperature, damage degree, and grain size. The intended range of application includes evolution towards rheological instability and subsequent recovery in lab- or crustal scale domains of up to three spatial dimensions. To this end, elastodynamic effects are modeled as required by the rheological time scale. We achieve these aims at reasonable computational cost through the use of an additive implicit-explicit (IMEX) split Runge-Kutta scheme with error estimation and step size control, in which individual PDE terms are solved implicitly, and coupling terms are solved explicitly. This results in a method in which numerical stability is not limited by spatial resolution.\n"

Body forces are ignored from here on ($\\vec{g}(t,\\vec{x}) = 0$) at no loss of generality -- although the physical framework developed here ignores self-gravitation. At considerable loss of generality, but required for the sake of concise argument, is our choice to ignore advection and distortion within the elastic body. The material derivative $\\tilde{d}/dt$, that is to be evaluated along the characteristic of flow, is replaced by the partial derivative $\\partial/\\partial t$. The divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{s}$ of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$, which formally is to be evaluated in coordinates $\\vec{x} + \\vec{u}$ distorted by displacement $\\vec{u} = \\vec{u}(t,\\vec{x})$, is instead evaluated in the reference coordinate system $\\vec{x}$.

    "The overall truncation error of this ARK scheme is $\\mathcal{O}(h_t^3)$ (it is thus accurate/consistent to second order), but the error measure $\\epsilon_{n+1}$ only estimates the truncation error associated with the implicit components, since the explicit scheme already has the maximal third-order accuracy that can be expected of an explicit three-stage RK method. We do not however see this as a major drawback since the explicitly solved subsystem can be expected to be highly stiff, with the time step chosen by {eq:3.20} sufficiently affected by the unphysical peripheral components of the spectrum that it causes the physical components to be exceedingly accurately solved. Since the implicitly solved PDE components are not subject to a stability barrier, the same argument does not extend to them and their error must be monitored, and the time step further reduced if necessary.\n",

    "Inspired by the multi-rate extension of TR-BDF2 of [Bonaventura et al., 2018], we design the following much simplified mechanism for controlling the error on the implicitly solved components of {eq:3.4}. We estimate the implicit error using {eq:3.21c}. Then, given the absolute and relative tolerances $\\tau_\\mathrm{a}$ and $\\tau_\\mathrm{r}$, we compute the dimensionless error measure\n",
