    "We present a numerical scheme for efficiently modeling the rheological evolution of rocks in response to changes in temperature, damage degree, and grain size. The intended range of application includes evolution towards rheological instability and subsequent recovery in lab- or crustal scale domains of up to three spatial dimensions. To this end, elastodynamic effects are modeled as required by the rheological time scale. We achieve these aims at reasonable computational cost through the use of an additive implicit-explicit (IMEX) split Runge-Kutta scheme with error estimation and step size control, in which individual PDE terms are solved implicitly, and coupling terms are solved explicitly. This results in a method in which numerical stability is not limited by spatial resolution."

Body forces are ignored from here on ($g = 0$) at no loss of generality -- although the physical framework developed here ignores self-gravitation. At considerable loss of generality, but required for the sake of concise argument we ignore advection and distortion within the elastic body by setting $x(t) = x$, with $x$ the coordinate in the reference configuration. The total time derivative $d_t f(t, x^\\ast(t))$ along the characteristic of flow $x(t)$ is consequently replaced by the partial time derivative $\\partial_t f(t, x)$. The divergence $\\nabla \\cdot s$ of the Cauchy stress tensor $s$, which formally is to be evaluated in deformed coordinates $x(t)$, is instead evaluated in the reference coordinate system $x$.

For the sake of simplicity of implementation we favor second-order accurate methods in both cases, which has the advantage that the combined accuracy of space and time discretization is also close to second-order [citation needed].\n",
    "\n",
    "When discretizing a system of ODEs like {eq:3.2} in time, we typically have a choice between so-called explicit and implicit methods. Explicit methods are algorithmically simple and have a low, constant computational cost per time step, but the step size is limited to some fraction of the characteristic time scale of the fastest-growing perturbations admitted by the ODE. Typically, perturbations grow much faster than the actual solution of the initial value problem, a phenomenon called stiffness [citation needed]. This problem is further exacerbated by PDE components in the right-hand-side of {eq:3.2}. After spatial discretization [Section 3.6], these admit perturbations whose characteristic time scale grows with the grid distance; linearly for hyperbolic PDE components and even quadratically for parabolic PDE components [citation needed].\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit methods on the other hand, do not suffer from time step restrictions when they are A-stable [Section 3.3], but require the solution of a (large) system of simultaneous algebraic equations, which incurs a considerable, non-constant cost per time step [citation needed]. Given a solution method whose algorithmic complexity scales sub-linearly with time step size, implicit schemes can easily outperform explicit schemes whenever the solution is 'slow'[^1] [citation needed]. However, as will become clear by [Section 3.6], our favored class of iterative, matrix-free solvers places various constraints on the properties of the operator $f$ summarized in {eq:3.xyzz}, such as positive (negitive) definiteness or symmetry. The physical processes modeled in {eq:3.1a}--{eq:3.1d} unfortunately do not result in such properties, except in limit cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major aims of this paper is the resolution of this problem. We propose an additive decomposition of the governing equations {eq:3.1a}--{eq:3.1d}, in which some of the PDE terms can be decoupled and solved with an implicit method in a routine way, and the remainder with an explicit method using an additive Runge-Kutta (ARK) scheme. We derive subsequently the properties of this time integration scheme, and show that the resulting time step constraints are independent of the spatial resolution, despite the fact that not all of the PDE components are treated implicitly. Finally, we embed into this scheme an error estimator and propose time step controls to keep the discretization error bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Here 'slow' is relative: the solution to a friction problem may e.g. be 'slow' both during the 'stick' and the 'slip' phases, and only be 'fast' during the transitions between the two."
